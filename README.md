# Description

The usual, trying capture all the ROM bugs for the Motorola boards. This
one is one of those and I beleive it to be a very popular ROM bug. Peter
Stark wrote this for the Motorola 6800, 6802, 6803, 6809 and 68k. I've
found the original articles, the cassette tapes for the Tandy MC10 (6801)
the Tandy CoCo (6809) and the PT68K-4 (68K).

While the articles give plenty of detail they are not complete and seem
to be made up of parts of different packages. Parts appear to be missing
so it's very confusing. In addition to the articles I have a mostly working
MC10 cassette version. This is really an odd image as it seems to overwrite
itself. I think it is a damaged version. But between the two and the Tandy
CoCo version (which I hope is intact) I hope to build a working Humbug ROM
for the 6800, 6802 & 6801.

Right now this is just a mess of files. It won't compile yet.
